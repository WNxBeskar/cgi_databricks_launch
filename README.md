## Medallion Architecture Overview

The Medallion Architecture is a data design pattern that organizes data into three layers:

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw, unfiltered data ingested from source systems.
- **Silver Layer:** Cleaned and enriched data, suitable for analytics.
- **Gold Layer:** Aggregated, business-level data for reporting and advanced analytics.

This approach improves data quality, reliability, and enables scalable data processing.

**Getting Started:**
- Put your enviroment in `Dark Mode`.
- Turn on cell line numbers.
- Please run the `00_seed_bronze` file in the `launch` folder to initialize your environment.
- The `01_example_load_bronze` file provides examples of how to extract data from the Bronze layer.

# Goals for Landing Bronze Data and Processing to Silver Layer

- **Ingest Raw Data (Bronze Layer):**
  - Collect raw, unprocessed data from landing volume.
  - Store data in its original format for traceability and auditing.
  - Ensure the following:
    - That the data has the correct datatype via schema inferance.
    - All columns are lowercase.
    - Add a metadata column with file name and file modification timestamp.
    - Add a ingested timestamp.

- **Clean and Normalize Data (Silver Layer):**
  - Silver Layer must be built using a `job` or `pipeline`.
  - Remove duplicates and correct data types.
  - Standardize formats and apply business rules.

  - Prepare data for analytics and downstream processing.


- **Enable Reliable Data Pipelines:**
  - Ensure data quality and consistency between layers.
  - Facilitate scalable and maintainable ETL workflows.

 

# Stretch Goals - This is entirely optional but should provide a fun challenge.

These advanced objectives focus on optimizing inventory management and supply chain operations using the Gold Layer of the Medallion Architecture. The Gold Layer aggregates business-level data, enabling strategic planning and analytics.

- **Supply Chain Chaos (Gold Layer):**
  - Model inventory `burn rate` based off of historic demand to predict future needs.
  - Determine MOQ (minimum order quantity) of each SKU per week for the next year to the factory, ensuring efficient ordering and production.
  - Build a shipping schedule for each SKU from warehouses to stores, optimizing logistics and delivery timelines.
  - Ensure that all stores have at least `3 weeks of stock` at any time to prevent stockouts and maintain customer satisfaction.
  - Account for warehouse lead times to store of `1 week` to accurately plan replenishments.
  - Account for factory lead times to warehouse of `4 weeks` to synchronize production and distribution.
  - Account for stores only being able to receive cases from the factory, which affects order quantities and packaging.

**Burn Rate**
  - Burn Rate is the rate at which inventory is consumed. For example, if you sell 10 widgets a week, then your burn rate for widgets is 10/week. Understanding burn rate helps forecast inventory needs and avoid shortages.

# Notes
  - To complete this assignment you will need to create the following: 
    - a calendar table.
    - complex algorithms that may span multiple tables or workbooks.
